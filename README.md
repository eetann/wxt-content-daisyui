# WXT + daisyUI

This sample should help get you started developing with daisyUI in WXT.

## MEMO
The following are already installed in this sample!

But I'll make a note of it because it's a pain to look it up every time.

### Install Tailwind CSS
[Install Tailwind CSS with Vite - Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#svelte)

```sh
pnpm add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
pnpm tailwindcss init -p
```

and edit `tailwind.config.js` and `app.css`.
